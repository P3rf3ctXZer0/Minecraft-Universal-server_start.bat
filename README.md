# Minecraft-Universal-server_start.bat
A basic batch file that lets you start whichever server is in the same directory

### The idea
- Simple double click server start
- No need to add a specific reference to the forge version being used
- Good to go, no file renaming needed
- No need to update the script if you update forge
